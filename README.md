# Youtube-Auto-Playlist-Liker
This JavaScript code automatically likes all unliked songs in a YouTube Music playlist. It checks the "Like" buttons and only clicks those with `aria-pressed="false"`, ensuring it doesn't dislike already liked songs. The script scrolls to load more songs and repeats the process until all songs are liked, then stops automatically.
